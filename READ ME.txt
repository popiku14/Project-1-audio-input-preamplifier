In this project, I designed the schematic and layout for an audio input preamplifier using OrCad, a widely used electronic design automation (EDA) software suite. The objective was to create a high-quality preamplifier circuit that could effectively amplify low-level audio signals from various input sources, while also minimizing noise and distortion. The design process involved the selection of appropriate components such as transistors, resistors, and capacitors, and the optimization of their values and placement using OrCad's advanced simulation and layout tools. Rigorous testing and evaluation were performed to ensure that the final design met the required specifications and performance criteria.
